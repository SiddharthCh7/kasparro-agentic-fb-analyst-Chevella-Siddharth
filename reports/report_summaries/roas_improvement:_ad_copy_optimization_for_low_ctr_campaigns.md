### Recommended Next Steps
1.  **Campaign Identification**: Pinpoint all active campaigns and ad groups with consistently low Click-Through Rates (CTR) over a defined period (e.g., last 30-60 days).
2.  **Current Ad Copy Audit**: Conduct a detailed review of the existing ad copy within these identified low-CTR campaigns. Analyze messaging, calls-to-action, unique selling propositions, and relevance to target keywords/audiences.
3.  **Audience & Competitor Research**: Deepen understanding of the target audience for these campaigns and analyze competitor ad copy to identify successful strategies and potential gaps.
4.  **Develop Optimized Ad Copy**: Create multiple new ad copy variations for each identified campaign. Focus on clarity, strong value propositions, compelling headlines, and clear calls-to-action tailored to resonate with the specific audience segment.
5.  **A/B Testing Strategy**: Plan and implement A/B tests to systematically compare the performance of new ad copy variations against the existing low-performing ones. Track key metrics including CTR, conversion rate, and ROAS.
6.  **Performance Monitoring & Iteration**: Continuously monitor the performance of new ad copy, scaling up successful variations and further iterating on underperforming ones to achieve sustained ROAS improvement.
